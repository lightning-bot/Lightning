## Versioning

Lightning is versioned as `major.minor.patch`.

This is similar to SemVer, with a few exceptions.

Major versions are incremented when the project undergoes a major rewrite.

Minor versions are incremented when a command's behavior has changed, functionality has been moved to another cog (where it makes sense to be), a command was removed, etc.

Patch versions are incremented when a bug has been fixed.
